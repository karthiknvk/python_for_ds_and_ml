7. How do you get the Docstring and method list pop-ups in Jupyter Notebook?

Use Tab with your cursor directly after a defined variable to see the list of methods. For example, given: my_list = [1,2,3] you could then run that cell to define my_list as a variable, afterwards you could just type: my_list. (notice the dot) and then press Tab to see the list of methods. For the doctrings of functions, use Shift+Tab with your cursor right after the function.
